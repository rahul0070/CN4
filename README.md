## Implementing Dijkstra algorithm (Link State)
Dijkstra's algorithm, also known as link state is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.

The **UserManual_Disjkstra.pfd** contains the instruction to run the code and the abstract concept implemented. We have modeled the topology to a particular one which can by modified by modifying the **topology.py** file.
